# eCommerce Data Science Assignment

This repository contains the solution for the eCommerce Transactions Dataset assignment, designed to test exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and clustering skills. The project is divided into three tasks: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Lookalike Model, and Customer Segmentation.

## **Project Overview**

The eCommerce Transactions dataset consists of three files:
1. `Customers.csv`: Contains customer profiles.
2. `Products.csv`: Contains product details.
3. `Transactions.csv`: Contains transaction histories.

### **Tasks**
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze customer, product, and transaction data.
   - Derive actionable business insights.
   - Provide visualizations to support findings.

2. **Lookalike Model**:
   - Build a model to recommend three similar customers for the first 20 customers based on transaction history and profile information.

3. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques.
   - Evaluate clusters using the Davies-Bouldin Index and visualize the results.
